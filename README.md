# RFIDentify
_For educational purpose_ ðŸŽ“

<b> RFIDentify </b> is a project carried out in order to learn more about the IoT technologies
And how to use the facilities it provides to elaborate a complete system that satisfies some
need.

In this case it is a RFID card reader, which accompanies a very developed system with
Modern technologies.

# Stack ðŸ’»
![Arduino, C++, Rust, Python, Qt](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=arduino,cpp,rust,python,qt&perline=5)

# How to install
In each module there is a readme document that explains how to install each of the subsystems

Here you can find each of the facilities:

- Arduino/Cpp
- Rust
- Python Desktop
- Python Server

# How does it work?
This system works by a layer architecture, where each layer has a very clear and specific purpose.
The existing layers are currently:

- Firmware (Arduino)
- Middleware (Rust)
- App Desktop (Python + PyQt)
- Server (FastAPI)

## Firmware
The firmware, primarily developed in C++ using the Arduino library, is responsible for managing and
controlling the physical components involved in the system's architecture. It provides detailed support
and control for peripherals such as LEDs, the RFID-RC522 reader, a buzzer, and physical buttons.
Additionally, it includes an integrated authentication system and a custom communication protocol built
around an API model, designed to establish robust interactions with other systems and to efficiently execute
tasks handled by the firmware's main controller.

## Middleware
The middleware plays a vital role in the system architecture, acting as an intelligent intermediary between the
embedded firmware and the visual applications. Its primary task is to automatically detect the IoT device connected
via the serial port and manage all input/output (I/O) operations related to it.

Additionally, it establishes a socket-based communication channel, allowing applications to connect efficiently and
interact bidirectionally with the middleware, thereby enabling seamless integration with the firmware.

The middleware also initiates communication with the microcontroller and serves as the main component responsible for
authentication, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access the system. Overall, it functions as a
secure and reliable communication bridge between the Arduino and high-level applications.

## Desktop
The desktop application plays a complementary role within the system, enabling direct user interaction with the data
generated by the IoT device. Its basic functionality involves establishing a connection with the middleware's socket to
receive information sent by the Arduino and to issue commands that control specific functions of the firmware.

Additionally, the application processes the data received from the Arduino and handles requests to the server, such as
retrieving user-related information or other system entities. In this setup, its main visual function is to display to
the user the data stored on the server, providing a clear and functional interface for system monitoring.

## Server
The server plays a central role in the system's architecture by managing the database and handling the storage of images
associated with various entities, such as users or registered events. It is built using FastAPI, chosen for its
simplicity, rapid development capabilities, and excellent performance under high-concurrency conditions.

This architecture enables the server to efficiently handle multiple simultaneous requests, supporting operations such as
authentication, database queries, and media resource management through a lightweight and scalable backend.
